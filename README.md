# Reddit-to-Instagram
This is a "library" that can help you creating an Instagram reposter, that makes posts from reddit submissions. It is fully your responsibility using this code and I do not support botting or commiting any crimes with it!

## Install 
You will need the [PHP Instagram API](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API) for this project. It is important that you cannot run this code in a web browser - by doing it, you will risk your Instagram account getting banned or you can crash the emulating process, done by the PHP Instagram API and make irreversible errors. You can run it on command line or maybe make a chron-job for it. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/wiki/FAQ#can-i-run-this-library-via-a-website).
